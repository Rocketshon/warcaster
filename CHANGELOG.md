## Round 12 — Adversarial Hardening (2026-03-25)
**12 bugs fixed**

### Button Spam Prevention
- **CreateCampaign**: `isSubmitting` guard prevents double-tap creating two campaigns
- **JoinCampaign**: `isJoining` guard prevents duplicate player rows on double-tap
- **PostBattleWizard**: `useRef` guard prevents double XP/RP award on rapid tap (React state was stale)
- **DatasheetView**: Add to Roster button disabled during success toast
- **DiceRoller**: `useRef` guard prevents overlapping interval/timeout pairs on mash

### Data Integrity
- **LogBattle**: Negative VP scores clamped to 0 with `Math.max(0, ...)`
- **sync.ts**: Local data captured BEFORE cloud overwrite in `syncAll` — prevents data loss on two-tab race
- **CrusadeContext**: `addUnit` moved `setUnits` out of `setCurrentPlayer` updater — React Strict Mode safe
- **BattleLobby/CombatTracker**: Guards undefined `battleId`, prevents writing engagements to wrong battle

### Feature Flag Route Gating
- CampaignMap, HallOfFame, BattleLobby, RequisitionStore redirect to `/home` when flag is disabled

### Input Validation
- CreateCampaign: supply limit clamped to `[1, 9999]`, included in `isFormValid`
